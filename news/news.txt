Parties in the Park - public launch of Finn Street O'Connor natural play space

Finn Street Park has plenty of natural elements available to kids for them to get creative with! The loose parts shop includes a range of sticks, rocks, logs and other elements. There is an outdoor amphitheater perfect for performances, classes and more.

Join in on the day with local community group led activities, including; mosaic craft, fruit tree planting, tug-o-war, skip rope and more.

The Canberra Parkour Association will also be there to do some super fun workshops for kids to learn how to run, jump and climb in urban environments.

Nature Play will be at each location providing information about natural play spaces and activities for kids and assisting with a mega nature scavenger hunt.

Don’t forget to grab a sausage sizzle from the local O’Connor Tocumwal Housing Precinct and an afternoon pick-me-up as coffee will be available for the parents.

The playground can be accessed via any of the surrounding streets including Finn Street, Quinn Street, Busby Street, Hart Street or Todd Street.
